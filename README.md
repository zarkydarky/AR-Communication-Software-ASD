# 🧩 AR Communication Software for Children with Autism

A Computer Engineering Capstone Project

---

## 📖 Overview

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially those who are non-verbal or minimally verbal, often face significant barriers to expressing emotions, needs, and intentions. This Computer Engineering Capstone project develops an Augmented Reality (AR) communication software that allows these children to learn, practice, and generalize communication skills in a safe, engaging, and customizable environment.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive and Customizable Environments:** Support individual needs with tailored content.
- **Visual Supports and Contextual Clues:** Enhance communication pathways.
- **Multi-Sensory AR Experiences:** Foster understanding and engagement.
- **Data Analytics & Progress Tracking:** Session recording and analysis for caregivers and professionals.
- **Companion Web Application:** Web-based dashboard for data visualization and progress monitoring.

The development follows an iterative prototyping approach, incorporating feedback from professionals and users to refine the application.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a fully functional standalone AR application for children with ASD using Meta Quest 3S headsets. (Status: Prototype Complete)
- Provide comprehensive tools for caregivers to customize content and track progress.
- Create a companion web application for data analysis and session monitoring.
- Implement modern software engineering practices to deliver a production-ready solution.

---

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **AR Platform:** Meta Quest 3S headsets
- **Development Environment:** Unity 3D (AR App)
- **Companion Platform:** Web application (Current Focus)
- **Target Deployment:** Standalone VR/AR application
- **Build System:** Unity Build Pipeline
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub
- **Testing Framework:** Meta Quest development tools and Unity Test Runner

## 🚀 Current Progress

**Capstone 2: Development & Implementation (In Progress)**

**Current Status (November 2025):** The standalone Augmented Reality (AR) application prototype for Meta Quest 3S is 100% complete (v1.07). The project focus has now shifted entirely to the development and implementation of the Companion Web Application.

---

## 🌟 AR Prototype Key Achievements (v1.07):

The AR application now includes all planned core functionality, menus, and data systems:

- **Implemented Activity Suite (100%):** All three therapeutic/educational modules are fully functional and integrated with the database:
  - **Object Identification:** Focuses on vocabulary and basic object recognition.
  - **Sentence Builder:** Requires the child to select the correct AR-rendered object to logically complete an incomplete sentence.
  - **Emotion Explorer:** An assessment tool requiring the child to select the appropriate emotion (Happy, Sad, Neutral, or Mad) based on a presented scenario.
- **Complete Data Management:** Full implementation of the secure, offline SQLite database, logging all session and response data correctly.
- **Data Export Finalized:** The 'Export Data' function is operational. It generates a comprehensive JSON file containing all relevant session data, ready for transfer and import into the Companion Web Application.
- **Full UI/UX Implementation:** All in-headset dashboard and activity menus are complete, including a Help / About menu.

---

## 🔨 Active Development Focus:

- **Companion Web Application Development (Primary Focus)**
- **Secure data import and visualization architecture (JSON parsing)**
- **Application refinement and final performance optimization of the AR prototype**

**Target Completion:** December 2025

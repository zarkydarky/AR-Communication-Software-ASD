# 🧩 AR Communication Software for Children with Autism  
**A Computer Engineering Capstone Project**
---
## 📖 Overview
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often face challenges in verbal communication, making it difficult for them to express their emotions and needs. This project, developed as part of a **Computer Engineering Capstone**, explores the creation of an **Augmented Reality (AR) communication software** tailored for children with ASD.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive and Customizable Environments:** Support individual needs with tailored content.
- **Visual Supports and Contextual Clues:** Enhance communication pathways.
- **Multi-Sensory AR Experiences:** Foster understanding and engagement.
- **Data Analytics & Progress Tracking:** Session recording and analysis for caregivers and professionals.
- **Companion Web Application:** Web-based dashboard for data visualization and progress monitoring.

The development follows an **iterative prototyping approach**, incorporating feedback from professionals and users to refine the application.
---
## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Develop a fully functional standalone AR application** for children with ASD using Meta Quest 3S headsets.
2. **Provide comprehensive tools for caregivers** to customize content and track progress.
3. **Create a companion web application** for data analysis and session monitoring.
4. **Implement modern software engineering practices** to deliver a production-ready solution.

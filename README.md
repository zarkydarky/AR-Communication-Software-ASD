# 🧩 AR Communication Software for Children with Autism  
**A Computer Engineering Capstone Project**

---

## 📖 Overview
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often face challenges in verbal communication, making it difficult for them to express their emotions and needs. This project, developed as part of a **Computer Engineering Capstone**, explores the creation of an **Augmented Reality (AR) communication software** tailored for children with ASD.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive and Customizable Environments:** Support individual needs with tailored content.
- **Visual Supports and Contextual Clues:** Enhance communication pathways.
- **Multi-Sensory AR Experiences:** Foster understanding and engagement.

The development follows an **iterative prototyping approach**, incorporating feedback from professionals and users to refine the application.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Develop engaging and interactive AR-based software** for children with ASD.
2. **Provide tools for caregivers** to customize content for individual needs.
3. **Implement modern software engineering practices** to deliver a functional prototype.
